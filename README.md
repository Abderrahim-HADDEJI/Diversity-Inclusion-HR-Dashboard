**Gender Balance in Leadership ‚Äì Power BI Dashboard**

This project showcases an interactive and insightful Power BI dashboard aimed at analyzing gender balance across leadership roles within an organization. The dashboard is built using a combination of **Power Query** for data transformation and **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** for calculated measures and KPIs.

Key features of the dashboard include:
- **Dynamic KPIs** to track the proportion of male vs. female leaders across various departments and levels.
- **Root Cause Analysis** tools that allow users to drill down into the data by team, role type, and time period.
- **Visual storytelling** using clustered column charts, pie charts, and decomposition trees to highlight gaps and opportunities.
- **Interactive slicers and filters** to tailor the view according to the user's focus‚Äîbe it department, job title, or time.
- Insights aimed at guiding **Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)** initiatives, by identifying underrepresented areas and supporting strategic workforce planning.

The goal of this project is to empower HR professionals and decision-makers with actionable insights that drive gender equity and promote inclusive leadership development.
